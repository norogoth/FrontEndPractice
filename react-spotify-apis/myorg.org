- created nodemon with npm so that it will live update. 
- Set up backend using ExpressJS
** NOTE: strategies
You can give a constructor an object with an execute method. This will duck type it to be a strategy.
- Set up Passport
- store clientId and clientSecret in .env
** NOTE: npm install -D
D stands for "dev dependency." You can see this in your package.json. 
** TODO Create Proxy Server
** TODO Fix current code to communicate with Spotify
